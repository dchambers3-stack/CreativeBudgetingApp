# Lazy Loading Implementation

This project now implements lazy loading with feature modules to improve performance and maintainability.

## New Route Structure

### Authentication Routes (`/auth`)

- `/auth/login` - User login
- `/auth/register` - User registration

### Budget Routes (`/budget`)

- `/budget/dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `/budget/pay-info` - Payment details
- `/budget/add-expenses` - Add new expenses
- `/budget/paychecks` - Paycheck management
- `/budget/how-to-budget` - Budgeting guide

### Helpdesk Routes (`/helpdesk`)

- `/helpdesk/create-ticket` - Create support ticket
- `/helpdesk/tickets` - View my tickets

## Features Implemented

1. **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded only when their routes are accessed
2. **Route Guards**: Authentication guard protects all budget and helpdesk routes
3. **Legacy Route Support**: Old routes redirect to new structure for backward compatibility

## Benefits

- **Improved Initial Load Time**: Only login/register components load initially
- **Better Code Organization**: Features are grouped logically
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing ones
- **Security**: Authentication guard ensures protected routes require login

## Migration Notes

- All existing routes have redirect fallbacks for backward compatibility
- Components remain in their original locations
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Improvements

- Consider moving components into feature folders
- Add more specific route guards (role-based access)
- Implement preloading strategies for better UX
