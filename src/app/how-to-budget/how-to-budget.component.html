    How to Budget (Dave Ramsey Style)
  </h1>

  <p class="lead text-center">
    Budgeting isn’t about limiting your freedom — it's about gaining control.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight my-4 strong-text">
    <strong>Zero-Based Budgeting</strong> means every dollar has a job. Income
    minus expenses should equal <strong>$0</strong>.
  </div>

  <h3 class="section-title">1. List Your Income</h3>
  <p>
    Write down all sources of monthly income: paychecks, side hustles, or any
    other money coming in.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-title">2. List All Expenses</h3>
  <p>
    Include everything — rent, food, entertainment, debt, savings. Organize them
    into categories to stay clear.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-title">3. Cover the Four Walls</h3>
  <p>Take care of essentials first:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Food</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Utilities</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Shelter</strong> (like rent/mortgage)</li>
    <li><strong>Transportation</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="section-title">4. Assign Every Dollar</h3>
  <p>
    Subtract each planned expense from your income until you hit zero. That
    includes saving and debt payments.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-title">5. Track & Adjust</h3>
  <p>
    Life isn’t perfect — if something changes mid-month, adjust your budget.
    Stay flexible and in control.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-title">6. Repeat Monthly</h3>
  <p>
    Do a fresh budget before each new month. Each one is different, so your plan
    should be too.
